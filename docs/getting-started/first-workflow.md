# Your First Workflow

Build a restaurant ordering workflow that demonstrates Aiki's key features: events, timeouts, child workflows, and durable sleep.

## What We'll Build

A restaurant ordering system that:
- Notifies the restaurant and waits for acceptance (with timeout)
- Coordinates courier delivery as a child workflow
- Sends a feedback email the next day

This workflow spans hours or days and coordinates multiple humans—exactly what Aiki is designed for.

## Step 1: Define Tasks

Each task is an independent unit of work that can be retried separately:

```typescript
import { task } from "@syi0808/workflow";

const notifyRestaurant = task({
	name: "notify-restaurant",
	async handler(input: { orderId: string; items: string[] }) {
		console.log(`Notifying restaurant about order ${input.orderId}`);
		console.log(`Items: ${input.items.join(", ")}`);
	},
	options: {
		retry: {
			type: "exponential",
			maxAttempts: 3,
			baseDelayMs: 1000,
		},
	},
});

const notifyCustomer = task({
	name: "notify-customer",
	async handler(input: { customerId: string; message: string }) {
		console.log(`To customer ${input.customerId}: ${input.message}`);
	},
});

const sendFeedbackEmail = task({
	name: "send-feedback-email",
	async handler(input: { orderId: string; customerId: string }) {
		console.log(`Sending feedback request for order ${input.orderId}`);
	},
});
```

## Step 2: Define the Courier Delivery Workflow

The courier delivery is a child workflow; a separate workflow that runs independently:

```typescript
import { event, workflow } from "@syi0808/workflow";

const courierDelivery = workflow({ name: "courier-delivery" });

const courierDeliveryV1 = courierDelivery.v("1.0.0", {
	async handler(run, input: { orderId: string; restaurantId: string }) {
		run.logger.info("Finding available courier...");

		// Simulate courier search
		await run.sleep("find-courier", { seconds: 2 });

		run.logger.info("Courier assigned, waiting for food to be ready...");

		// Wait for restaurant to signal food is ready
		await run.events.foodReady.wait();

		run.logger.info("Food ready! Courier picking up...");
		await run.sleep("delivery", { seconds: 2 });

		run.logger.info("Order delivered!");
		return { courierName: "Oluwafemi" };
	},
	events: {
		foodReady: event(),
	},
});
```

## Step 3: Define the Main Restaurant Order Workflow

This workflow orchestrates the entire order process:

```typescript
const restaurantOrder = workflow({ name: "restaurant-order" });

const restaurantOrderV1 = restaurantOrder.v("1.0.0", {
	async handler(run, input: { orderId: string; customerId: string; items: string[] }) {
		// Step 1: Notify restaurant
		await notifyRestaurant.start(run, {
			orderId: input.orderId,
			items: input.items,
		});

		// Step 2: Wait for restaurant to accept (with 5 minute timeout)
		const response = await run.events.restaurantAccepted.wait({
			timeout: { minutes: 5 },
		});

		if (response.timeout) {
			await notifyCustomer.start(run, {
				customerId: input.customerId,
				message: "Restaurant didn't respond. Order cancelled.",
			});
			return { status: "cancelled", reason: "timeout" };
		}

		// Step 3: Notify customer of acceptance
		await notifyCustomer.start(run, {
			customerId: input.customerId,
			message: `Order confirmed! Estimated time: ${response.data.estimatedTime} mins`,
		});

		// Step 4: Start courier delivery as child workflow
		// (with reference ID for external access)
		const deliveryHandle = await courierDeliveryV1
			.with()
			.opt("reference.id", input.orderId)
			.startAsChild(run, {
				orderId: input.orderId,
				restaurantId: "restaurant-1",
			});

		// Step 5: Wait for delivery to complete
		const deliveryResult = await deliveryHandle.waitForStatus("completed");
		if (!deliveryResult.success) {
			return { status: "failed", reason: "delivery_failed" };
		}

		// Step 6: Notify customer of delivery (using child workflow output)
		const { courierName } = deliveryResult.state.output;
		await notifyCustomer.start(run, {
			customerId: input.customerId,
			message: `Your order was delivered by ${courierName}. Enjoy!`,
		});

		// Step 7: Sleep for 1 day, then request feedback
		await run.sleep("feedback-delay", { days: 1 });
		await sendFeedbackEmail.start(run, {
			orderId: input.orderId,
			customerId: input.customerId,
		});

		return { status: "completed", orderId: input.orderId };
	},
	events: {
		restaurantAccepted: event<{ estimatedTime: number }>(),
	},
});
```

## Step 4: Set Up Infrastructure

Create the client and worker:

```typescript
import process from "node:process";
import { client } from "@syi0808/client";
import { worker } from "@syi0808/worker";

const aikiClient = client({
	url: "http://localhost:9850",
	apiKey: "your-api-key",
});

const aikiWorker = worker({
	workflows: [restaurantOrderV1, courierDeliveryV1],
});

const workerHandle = await aikiWorker.spawn(aikiClient);

// Graceful shutdown
process.on("SIGINT", async () => {
	await workerHandle.stop();
	process.exit(0);
});
```

> **Note:** In production, workers typically run in a separate terminal or process from your application code. The worker runs continuously, listening for work, while your API or scripts start workflows as needed. For this tutorial, we're combining everything in one file for simplicity.

## Step 5: Execute the Workflow

Start the workflow and send events:

```typescript
// Start the order workflow
const orderId = crypto.randomUUID();
const customerId = crypto.randomUUID();

const handle = await restaurantOrderV1.start(aikiClient, {
	orderId,
	customerId,
	items: ["Burger", "Fries", "Drink"],
});

console.log("Workflow started:", handle.run.id);

// Simulate restaurant accepting the order after 3 seconds
setTimeout(async () => {
	await handle.events.restaurantAccepted.send({ estimatedTime: 30 });
	console.log("Restaurant accepted the order!");
}, 3000);

// In a real app, the restaurant would send the foodReady event via API
// when the food is prepared. For this demo, we'll simulate it:
setTimeout(async () => {
	// Get the courier delivery workflow handle using the order ID as reference
	const courierHandle = await courierDeliveryV1.getHandleByReferenceId(aikiClient, orderId);
	await courierHandle.events.foodReady.send();
	console.log("Food is ready for pickup!");
}, 10000);

// Wait for completion (this will take a while due to the 1-day sleep)
const result = await handle.waitForStatus("completed");
if (result.success) {
	console.log("Order completed:", result.state.output);
}
```

## What's Happening?

This workflow demonstrates Aiki's key features:

**Events & Timeouts**
The workflow waits for the restaurant to accept, but won't wait forever. If no response comes within 5 minutes, it cancels the order automatically.

**Child Workflows**
Courier delivery runs as a separate workflow. It can be monitored independently, and if the main workflow crashes, the child continues running.

**Durable Sleep**
The 1-day wait for feedback doesn't block any workers or consume resources. The workflow simply resumes the next day.

**Crash Recovery**
If the server crashes at any point—during payment, delivery, or the 1-day wait—the workflow resumes exactly where it left off.
